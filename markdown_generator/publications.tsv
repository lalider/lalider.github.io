2021-05-01	MirrorBlender: Supporting Hybrid Meetings with a Malleable Video-Conferencing System	CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	In hybrid meetings, multiple co-located participants communicate with remote participants through video. But video communication inhibits non-verbal cues, and this often causes remote participants to feel excluded. To address this issue, we built MirrorBlender: a What-You-See-Is-What-I-See video-conferencing system for blending, repositioning, and resizing mirrors. Mirrors here denote shared video feeds of people and screens. In a qualitative study of MirrorBlender with three hybrid meeting sessions, we found that the shared control of mirrors supported users in negotiating a blended interpersonal space. Moreover, it enabled diverse acts of inclusion of remote participants. In particular, remote participants brought attention to themselves by manipulating the position, scale, and translucency of their camera and screen feeds. Participants also embodied and leveraged their mirror images for deictic gestures and playful interactions. Based on these findings, we discuss new opportunities for supporting video-mediated collaboration.	Jens Emil Grønbæk, Banu Saatçi, Carla F. Griggio, and Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose. 2021.

2021-05-02	Mediating Intimacy with DearBoard: a Co-Customizable Keyboard for Everyday Messaging	CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	Co-customizations are collaborative customizations in messaging apps that all conversation members can view and change, e.g. the color of chat bubbles on Facebook Messenger. Co-customizations grant new opportunities for expressing intimacy; however, most apps offer private customizations only. To investigate how people in close relationships integrate co-customizations into their established communication app ecosystems, we built DearBoard: an Android keyboard that allows two people to co-customize its color theme and a toolbar of expression shortcuts (emojis and GIFs). In a 5-week field study with 18 pairs of couples, friends, and relatives, participants expressed their shared interests, history, and knowledge of each other through co-customizations that served as meaningful decorations, interface optimizations, conversation themes, and non-verbal channels for playful, affectionate interactions. The co-ownership of the co-customizations invited participants to negotiate who customizes what and for whom they customize. We discuss how co-customizations mediate intimacy through place-making efforts and suggest design opportunities.	Carla F. Griggio, Arissa J. Sato, Wendy E. Mackay, and Koji Yatani. 2021.

2021-10-01	Social Computing and Collaborative Work in Latin America and Beyond	CSCW '21: Companion Publication of the 2021 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing	Previous initiatives have identified the potential of the Latin American region for CSCW research. However, CSCW work in the region is still disconnected, produced by small, isolated groups that often have a hard time learning about each other and finding opportunities to do research together. This workshop is an initiative of the SIGCHI Latin America Committee to bring these groups together to discuss their research, the challenges they perceive, and the possible initiatives that could be conducted to strengthen the region.

2020-05-01	Fostering HCI Research in, by, and for Latin America	CHI EA '20: Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	Over the last 20 years, the Latin American Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community has been working to shed light on how the diverse populations in the region are adopting, using, and making sense of computational technologies. Latin America's tense socio-political context, plurality of languages, collectivist culture, and historical relationship with the Global North make it a unique and rich space for HCI research. Considering the growing number of studies about Latin American communities and the emergent efforts to contribute to the HCI literature, we propose to host a SIG meeting at the 2020 ACM CHI conference. Our goal is to consolidate these efforts to better promote HCI research in, by, and for Latin America, by (1) bringing together researchers, practitioners, and students who are interested in engaging with Latin America through their research and practice, (2) envisioning a shared research agenda, and (3) identifying strategies for making its contributions more visible and impactful in the international community.

2019-11-01	Customizations and Expression Breakdowns in Ecosystems of Communication Apps	Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction Volume 3, CSCW (November 2019) 	The growing adoption of emojis, stickers and GIFs suggests a corresponding demand for rich, personalized expression in messaging apps. Some people customize apps to enable more personal forms of expression, yet we know little about how such customizations shape everyday communication. Since people increasingly communicate via multiple apps side-by-side, we are also interested in how customizing one app influences communication via other apps. We created a taxonomy of customization options based on interviews with 15 "extreme users" of communication apps. We found that participants tailored their apps to express their identities, organizational culture, and intimate bonds with others. They also experienced expression breakdowns: frustrations around barriers to transferring personal forms of expression across apps, which inspired inventive workarounds to maintain cross-app habits of expression, such as briefly switching apps to generate and export content for a particular conversation. We conclude with implications for personalized expression in ecosystems of communication apps.	Carla F. Griggio, Joanna McGrenere, and Wendy E. Mackay. 2019.
