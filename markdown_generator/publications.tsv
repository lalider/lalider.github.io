2021-05-01	MirrorBlender: Supporting Hybrid Meetings with a Malleable Video-Conferencing System	CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	In hybrid meetings, multiple co-located participants communicate with remote participants through video. But video communication inhibits non-verbal cues, and this often causes remote participants to feel excluded. To address this issue, we built MirrorBlender: a What-You-See-Is-What-I-See video-conferencing system for blending, repositioning, and resizing mirrors. Mirrors here denote shared video feeds of people and screens. In a qualitative study of MirrorBlender with three hybrid meeting sessions, we found that the shared control of mirrors supported users in negotiating a blended interpersonal space. Moreover, it enabled diverse acts of inclusion of remote participants. In particular, remote participants brought attention to themselves by manipulating the position, scale, and translucency of their camera and screen feeds. Participants also embodied and leveraged their mirror images for deictic gestures and playful interactions. Based on these findings, we discuss new opportunities for supporting video-mediated collaboration.	Jens Emil Grønbæk, Banu Saatçi, Carla F. Griggio, and Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose. 2021.

2021-05-02	Mediating Intimacy with DearBoard: a Co-Customizable Keyboard for Everyday Messaging	CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	Co-customizations are collaborative customizations in messaging apps that all conversation members can view and change, e.g. the color of chat bubbles on Facebook Messenger. Co-customizations grant new opportunities for expressing intimacy; however, most apps offer private customizations only. To investigate how people in close relationships integrate co-customizations into their established communication app ecosystems, we built DearBoard: an Android keyboard that allows two people to co-customize its color theme and a toolbar of expression shortcuts (emojis and GIFs). In a 5-week field study with 18 pairs of couples, friends, and relatives, participants expressed their shared interests, history, and knowledge of each other through co-customizations that served as meaningful decorations, interface optimizations, conversation themes, and non-verbal channels for playful, affectionate interactions. The co-ownership of the co-customizations invited participants to negotiate who customizes what and for whom they customize. We discuss how co-customizations mediate intimacy through place-making efforts and suggest design opportunities.	Carla F. Griggio, Arissa J. Sato, Wendy E. Mackay, and Koji Yatani. 2021.
