2021-05-01	MirrorBlender: Supporting Hybrid Meetings with a Malleable Video-Conferencing System	CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	In hybrid meetings, multiple co-located participants communicate with remote participants through video. But video communication inhibits non-verbal cues, and this often causes remote participants to feel excluded. To address this issue, we built MirrorBlender: a What-You-See-Is-What-I-See video-conferencing system for blending, repositioning, and resizing mirrors. Mirrors here denote shared video feeds of people and screens. In a qualitative study of MirrorBlender with three hybrid meeting sessions, we found that the shared control of mirrors supported users in negotiating a blended interpersonal space. Moreover, it enabled diverse acts of inclusion of remote participants. In particular, remote participants brought attention to themselves by manipulating the position, scale, and translucency of their camera and screen feeds. Participants also embodied and leveraged their mirror images for deictic gestures and playful interactions. Based on these findings, we discuss new opportunities for supporting video-mediated collaboration.	Jens Emil Grønbæk, Banu Saatçi, Carla F. Griggio, and Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose. 2021.

2021-05-02	Mediating Intimacy with DearBoard: a Co-Customizable Keyboard for Everyday Messaging	CHI '21: Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	Co-customizations are collaborative customizations in messaging apps that all conversation members can view and change, e.g. the color of chat bubbles on Facebook Messenger. Co-customizations grant new opportunities for expressing intimacy; however, most apps offer private customizations only. To investigate how people in close relationships integrate co-customizations into their established communication app ecosystems, we built DearBoard: an Android keyboard that allows two people to co-customize its color theme and a toolbar of expression shortcuts (emojis and GIFs). In a 5-week field study with 18 pairs of couples, friends, and relatives, participants expressed their shared interests, history, and knowledge of each other through co-customizations that served as meaningful decorations, interface optimizations, conversation themes, and non-verbal channels for playful, affectionate interactions. The co-ownership of the co-customizations invited participants to negotiate who customizes what and for whom they customize. We discuss how co-customizations mediate intimacy through place-making efforts and suggest design opportunities.	Carla F. Griggio, Arissa J. Sato, Wendy E. Mackay, and Koji Yatani. 2021.

2021-10-01	Social Computing and Collaborative Work in Latin America and Beyond	CSCW '21: Companion Publication of the 2021 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing	Previous initiatives have identified the potential of the Latin American region for CSCW research. However, CSCW work in the region is still disconnected, produced by small, isolated groups that often have a hard time learning about each other and finding opportunities to do research together. This workshop is an initiative of the SIGCHI Latin America Committee to bring these groups together to discuss their research, the challenges they perceive, and the possible initiatives that could be conducted to strengthen the region.

2020-05-01	Fostering HCI Research in, by, and for Latin America	CHI EA '20: Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	Over the last 20 years, the Latin American Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community has been working to shed light on how the diverse populations in the region are adopting, using, and making sense of computational technologies. Latin America's tense socio-political context, plurality of languages, collectivist culture, and historical relationship with the Global North make it a unique and rich space for HCI research. Considering the growing number of studies about Latin American communities and the emergent efforts to contribute to the HCI literature, we propose to host a SIG meeting at the 2020 ACM CHI conference. Our goal is to consolidate these efforts to better promote HCI research in, by, and for Latin America, by (1) bringing together researchers, practitioners, and students who are interested in engaging with Latin America through their research and practice, (2) envisioning a shared research agenda, and (3) identifying strategies for making its contributions more visible and impactful in the international community.

2019-11-01	Customizations and Expression Breakdowns in Ecosystems of Communication Apps	Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction Volume 3, CSCW (November 2019) 	The growing adoption of emojis, stickers and GIFs suggests a corresponding demand for rich, personalized expression in messaging apps. Some people customize apps to enable more personal forms of expression, yet we know little about how such customizations shape everyday communication. Since people increasingly communicate via multiple apps side-by-side, we are also interested in how customizing one app influences communication via other apps. We created a taxonomy of customization options based on interviews with 15 "extreme users" of communication apps. We found that participants tailored their apps to express their identities, organizational culture, and intimate bonds with others. They also experienced expression breakdowns: frustrations around barriers to transferring personal forms of expression across apps, which inspired inventive workarounds to maintain cross-app habits of expression, such as briefly switching apps to generate and export content for a particular conversation. We conclude with implications for personalized expression in ecosystems of communication apps.	Carla F. Griggio, Joanna McGrenere, and Wendy E. Mackay. 2019.

2019-05-01	Augmenting Couples' Communication with Lifelines: Shared Timelines of Mixed Contextual Information	CHI '19: Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	Couples exhibit special communication practices, but apps rarely offer couple-specific functionality. Research shows that sharing streams of contextual information (e.g. location, motion) helps couples coordinate and feel more connected. Most studies explored a single, ephemeral stream; we study how couples' communication changes when sharing multiple, persistent streams. We designed Lifelines, a mobile-app technology probe that visualizes up to six streams on a shared timeline: closeness to home, battery level, steps, media playing, texts and calls. A month-long study with nine couples showed that partners interpreted information mostly from individual streams, but also combined them for more nuanced interpretations. Persistent streams allowed missing data to become meaningful and provided new ways of understanding each other. Unexpected patterns from any stream can trigger calls and texts, whereas seeing expected data can replace direct communication, which may improve or disrupt established communication practices. We conclude with design implications for mediating awareness within couples.	Carla F. Griggio, Midas Nouwens, Joanna McGrenere, and Wendy E. Mackay. 2019.

2017-10-01	CommandBoard: Creating a General-Purpose Command Gesture Input Space for Soft Keyboard	UIST '17: Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology	CommandBoard offers a simple, efficient and incrementally learnable technique for issuing gesture commands from a soft keyboard. We transform the area above the keyboard into a command-gesture input space that lets users draw unique command gestures or type command names followed by execute. Novices who pause see an in-context dynamic guide, whereas experts simply draw. Our studies show that CommandBoard's inline gesture shortcuts are significantly faster (almost double) than markdown symbols and significantly preferred by users. We demonstrate additional techniques for more complex commands, and discuss trade-offs with respect to the user's knowledge and motor skills, as well as the size and structure of the command space.

2017-05-01	Fieldward and Pathward: Dynamic Guides for Defining Your Own Gestures	CHI '17: Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	Although users accomplish ever more tasks on touch-enabled mobile devices, gesture-based interaction remains limited and almost never customizable by users. Our goal is to help users create gestures that are both personally memorable and reliably recognized by a touch-enabled mobile device. We address these competing requirements with two dynamic guides that use progressive feedforward to interactively visualize the "negative space" of unused gestures: the Pathward technique suggests four possible completions to the current gesture, and the Fieldward technique uses color gradients to reveal optimal directions for creating recognizable gestures. We ran a two-part experiment in which 27 participants each created 42 personal gesture shortcuts on a smartphone, using Pathward, Fieldward or No Feedforward. The Fieldward technique best supported the most common user strategy, i.e. to create a memorable gesture first and then adapt it to be recognized by the system. Users preferred the Fieldward technique to Pathward or No Feedforward, and remembered gestures more easily when using the technique. Dynamic guides can help developers design novel gesture vocabularies and support users as they design custom gestures for mobile applications.	Joseph Malloch, Carla F.

2017-05-02	"WhatsApp is for family; Messenger is for friends": Communication Places in App Ecosystems	CHI '17: Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	Today's users communicate via multiple apps, even when they offer almost identical functionality. We studied how and why users distribute their contacts within their app ecosystem. We found that the contacts in an app affect a user's conversations with other contacts, their communication patterns in the app, and the quality of their social relationships. Users appropriate the features and technical constraints of their apps to create idiosyncratic communication places, each with its own recursively defined membership rules, perceived purposes, and emotional connotations. Users also shift the boundaries of their communication places to accommodate changes in their contacts' behaviour, the dynamics of their relationships, and the restrictions of the technology. We argue that communication apps should support creating multiple communication places within the same app, relocating conversations across apps, and accessing functionality from other apps.
