I'm a post-doc researcher at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.au.dk/) at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), working with [Susanne Bødker](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/susanne-boedker(87d4fbb6-b38c-449e-b87d-59f693b7d6f0).html) in the [Collaboration & Computer-Human Interaction (CoCHI)](https://cs.au.dk/research/collaboration-and-computer-human-interaction-research-group) team. My main research studies how communication technologies, especially messaging apps, affect interpersonal relationships. I conduct empirical studies to understand how people adapt software to fit their communication needs and build prototypes that explore ways of providing them with richer control over their expression and relationship maintenance. I'm currently studying interoperability between messaging apps and exploring alternative software models to "apps" for online communication.

Before starting my current post-doc, I also worked as a post-doc at the Department of Digital Design and Information Studies in Aarhus University with [Clemens Klokmose](https://cs.au.dk/~clemens/) and at the [IIS Lab](https://iis-lab.org/) in [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) with [Koji Yatani](https://iis-lab.org/member/koji-yatani/). My defended my Ph.D. thesis "[Designing for Ecosystems of Communication Apps](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-02157268v1)" in 2018, which I did at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) and [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) under the supervision of [Wendy Mackay](https://ex-situ.lri.fr/people/mackay). I'm an [EIT Digital alumni](https://alumni.eitdigital.eu/) from the Human-Computer Interaction and Design Master Program in Université Paris-Saclay and [KTH](https://www.kth.se/). Before specializing on HCI, I studied Information Systems Engineering in [Universidad Tecnológica Nacional](https://utn.edu.ar/es/) in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
