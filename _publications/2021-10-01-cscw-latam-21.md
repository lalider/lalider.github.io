excerpt: 'Previous initiatives have identified the potential of the Latin American region for CSCW research. However, CSCW work in the region is still disconnected, produced by small, isolated groups that often have a hard time learning about each other and finding opportunities to do research together. This workshop is an initiative of the SIGCHI Latin America Committee to bring these groups together to discuss their research, the challenges they perceive, and the possible initiatives that could be conducted to strengthen the region.'
