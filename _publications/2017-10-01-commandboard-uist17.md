excerpt: 'CommandBoard offers a simple, efficient and incrementally learnable technique for issuing gesture commands from a soft keyboard. We transform the area above the keyboard into a command-gesture input space that lets users draw unique command gestures or type command names followed by execute. Novices who pause see an in-context dynamic guide, whereas experts simply draw. Our studies show that CommandBoard&apos;s inline gesture shortcuts are significantly faster (almost double) than markdown symbols and significantly preferred by users. We demonstrate additional techniques for more complex commands, and discuss trade-offs with respect to the user&apos;s knowledge and motor skills, as well as the size and structure of the command space.'
